# DataMap

DataMap is an experimental macOS app written in Swift that visualizes and explores spatial data structures in a graphical way.

## 🚀 Overview

DataMap focuses on:

- Visualizing file hierarchies and spatial relationships
- Graph layouts and rendering
- Performance-aware scanning and indexing
- SwiftUI + Metal based visualization

This project serves as an experimental learning tool and proof of concept.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Spatial indexing** (Octrees, BVH)
- **Graph layout algorithms**
- **Efficient file system scanning**
- **High-performance rendering (Metal)**

## 🧩 Features (Work in Progress)

- Display file system structures in 2D/3D
- Graph based layout visualizations
- Interactive UI with SwiftUI
- Multiple engine components for experimentation

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Swift
- SwiftUI
- Metal
- macOS
